1. Grocery List Scenario

To add a new item to the end of the list, you can use a method like .push(), which places the item at the last position of the array.
This keeps your list growing as you shop.

To remove the last item, you can use .pop(), which deletes the final element and returns it in case you need to check what was removed.

To find the position of a specific item, you can use .indexOf(), which searches the array and gives you the exact index where that item is located.

2. Playlist Management

Built-in methods like .sort() can organize songs alphabetically, by genre, or by artist, making it easier for users to browse their music. Meanwhile,
.reverse() can quickly flip the order of the playlist, 
which is great for people who want to hear their music from newest to oldest or vice versa.

3. Daily Schedule Organizer

To reorder tasks by priority, .sort() can help you arrange them in the order you need, like from most urgent to least urgent.

To remove a cancelled task, .splice() is useful because it lets you delete an item at any specific index in the array.

To insert a new task in a specific time slot, you can again use .splice(), but this time with parameters that allow you to insert without deleting anything.

4. Friend List in a Social App

A method like .includes() helps you check if a person is already in your friend list by returning true or false. If the person isn't found,
you can then use .push() to add them safely without creating duplicates.
