     Given an array of exam scores:

To find the highest and lowest scores, you can use methods like Math.max() and Math.min() together with the spread operator to scan through the entire array.
These functions quickly return the largest and smallest values.

To sort the scores from lowest to highest, you can use .sort() with a compare function, which arranges the numbers in proper numeric order.

To remove duplicate scores, you can use a Set, which automatically filters out duplicates, and then convert it back to an array.

     Given a string of characters stored in an array:

To count how many characters there are, you can check the .length property, which returns the total number of elements.

To reverse the order of characters, .reverse() instantly flips the array so the last character becomes the first.

To join them into a complete word or sentence, you can use .join("") or .join(" ") depending on whether you want spaces.

     For a travel itinerary planner:

To add a destination at the beginning, you can use .unshift(), which inserts an item at index 0.

To remove the last destination, .pop() works perfectly because it deletes the final element in the list.

To check if a certain location is included, .includes() can confirm whether that destination is part of the array.

     For alphabetizing student names using sort() and slice():

.sort() arranges all the names in proper alphabetical order automatically.

.slice(0, 5) can then be used to extract just the top 5 names from the sorted list without modifying the original array.

     Filtering only even numbers from an integer array:

A built-in method like .filter() makes it easy by letting you keep only the numbers that pass a condition—here,
num % 2 === 0. This instantly gives you an array containing just the even values.
